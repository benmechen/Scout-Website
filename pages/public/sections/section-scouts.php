		<p class="scouts-about">Scouts are the third Section of the Scouting movement. Scouts are encouraged to take part in a wide range of activities as part of their programme - participation is the key approach and for the Scout who wants to be recognised for their achievements there are a number of Challenges, Awards and Activity Badges... Scouts take part in a balanced programme that helps them to find out about the world in which they live, encourages them to know their own abilities and the importance of keeping fit and helps develop their creative talents, it also provides opportunities to explore their own values and personal attitudes. Being outdoors is important and half the programme is given over to taking part in both the traditional Scouting skills such as camping, survival and cooking as well as the wide range of adventurous activities, anything from abseiling to yachting. Scouting is about being with friends, as part of a team, participating fully in the adventure and opportunities of life.</p>
