		<p class="cubs-about">Cubs are the second Section of the Scouting movement. There are loads of fun things that you can do as a Cub Scout - you will get a chance to try lots of different activities like swimming, music, exploring, computing and collecting - if you do them well you can get a badge which you can wear on your uniform. Cub Scouts also get to go on trips and days out to places like the zoo, theme parks or a farm - you'll also get to go camping with the rest of your Pack - this will mean sleeping in a tent and doing loads of outdoor activities.</p>
