		<p class="explorers-about">Not all Units meet every week, partly due to activities, holidays, exams and the other commitments that crop up in a teenager's life, and also because Explorers tend to get out and about at weekends more often than other sections. Explorer Scouts often get the chance to work with other Explorer Scouts in their District, not just their own Unit, so can take part in an even wider spectrum of activities. There is also a range of ambitious badges and awards, through which Explorers can demonstrate their proficiencies and expand their interests.</p>
